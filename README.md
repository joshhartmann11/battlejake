# battlejake

Battlejake is an if-else snake. I started him at 9 the night before Battlesnake 2018 and he did pretty good all things considered.  Battlejake's weaknesses are getting trapped and starving, I think that the addition of a flood fill and pathfinding algorithm to miitigate those would make him a really strong snake...

And yes, I changed a few things after Battlesnake so that I would have a better footing for next year.
